# genzplyr 💅

> dplyr but make it bussin fr fr no cap

## What is this?

`genzplyr` is an alternative syntax for `dplyr` that replaces boring old function names with GenZ slang. Your data wrangling is about to hit different.

## Installation

```r
source("genzplyr.R")
```

## The translation guide

| dplyr verb | genzplyr verb | Meaning |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| `filter()` | `yeet()` | Remove rows that don't pass the vibe check |
| `select()` | `vibe_check()` | Keep only columns that matter |
| `mutate()` | `glow_up()` | Transform your data into its best self |
| `summarise()` | `no_cap()` | Get real summary stats, no lies |
| `arrange()` | `slay()` | Sort by slay factor |
| `group_by()` | `squad_up()` | Group data into squads |
| `ungroup()` | `disband()` | Break up the squad |
| `rename()` | `lowkey()` | Change names on the down-low |
| `distinct()` | `periodt()` | Remove duplicates, and that's on periodt |
| `pull()` | `main_character()` | Extract a column (give it main character energy) |
| `slice_head()` | `send_it()` | Take the top rows and send it |
| `count()` | `its_giving()` | Count occurrences (it's giving statistics) |

## Examples that slap

### Basic workflow

**Old way (cringe):**
```r
mtcars |>
  filter(mpg > 20) |>
  select(mpg, cyl, hp) |>
  mutate(kpg = mpg * 1.6) |>
  arrange(desc(mpg))
```

**New way (bussin):**
```r
mtcars |>
  yeet(mpg > 20) |>
  vibe_check(mpg, cyl, hp) |>
  glow_up(kpg = mpg * 1.6) |>
  slay(desc(mpg))
```

### Grouped summaries

**Old way:**
```r
mtcars |>
  group_by(cyl) |>
  summarise(
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg),
    max_hp = max(hp)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_mpg))
```

**New way (hits different):**
```r
mtcars |>
  squad_up(cyl) |>
  no_cap(
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg),
    max_hp = max(hp)
  ) |>
  slay(desc(avg_mpg))
```

### Complex analysis

```r
# Find high-performance 4-cylinder cars
mtcars |>
  yeet(cyl == 4, hp > 90) |>           # Only 4-cyl with decent power
  vibe_check(mpg, hp, wt, qsec) |>     # Relevant columns only
  glow_up(                              # Add some calculations
    power_to_weight = hp / wt,
    efficiency_score = mpg * hp / wt
  ) |>
  slay(desc(efficiency_score)) |>      # Sort by best score
  send_it(5)                            # Top 5
```

### Renaming columns lowkey

```r
mtcars |>
  lowkey(
    miles_per_gallon = mpg,
    horse_power = hp,
    weight = wt
  ) |>
  vibe_check(miles_per_gallon, horse_power, weight)
```

### Getting unique values periodt

```r
# See what cylinder options exist
mtcars |>
  periodt(cyl) |>
  slay(cyl)

# Count cars by cylinder and gear combo
mtcars |>
  its_giving(cyl, gear) |>
  slay(desc(n))
```

### Extract main character data

```r
# Get all MPG values as a vector
mpg_values <- mtcars |>
  yeet(cyl == 4) |>
  main_character(mpg)

mean(mpg_values)  # Average MPG for 4-cylinder cars
```

### The full send

```r
# Complete analysis that's absolutely bussin
mtcars |>
  yeet(hp > 100) |>                    # Yeet the weak cars
  vibe_check(mpg, cyl, hp, wt) |>      # Vibe check our columns
  glow_up(                              # Glow up the data
    hp_per_ton = hp / (wt / 2),
    efficiency = mpg / (hp / 100)
  ) |>
  squad_up(cyl) |>                     # Squad up by cylinders
  no_cap(                               # Get the real stats
    avg_hp = mean(hp),
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg),
    avg_efficiency = mean(efficiency),
    squad_size = n()
  ) |>
  disband() |>                         # Disband the squads
  slay(desc(avg_efficiency)) |>        # Sort by slay factor
  send_it(10)                          # Send it!
```

## Run the demo

```r
demo_genzplyr()
```

## Why tho?

Because data science should be fun and your code should reflect your personality. Also, imagine the look on your professor's face when you submit an analysis using `yeet()` and `squad_up()`.

## Is this production ready?

Bestie, this is for vibes only. Maybe don't use this in your Fortune 500 company's quarterly earnings report.
